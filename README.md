# nand2tetris
Nand2tetris is a course offered by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It gives an insight into processor design , starting from a very basic Nand gate. This repo has the project solutions.

NAND being a universal gate can theorotically be used to build any circuit. We shall rely on this concept and start building out various components using the Nand Gate.

The project relies on using different levels of abstraction. Using Nand Gates we build the other basic gates that we require such as And,Or,Xor,Not and so o. Now using these gates , we build higher blocks by instantiating these smaller compoenents. In this way at the end of Projct_06 we shall have a basic processor in our hands with our very own ALU and control unit. 

Tune in to check out other projects on computer architecture , VLSI design and varied fields of electronics.

Project_01 contains codes for all the basic gates such as And,OR,And_16 , i.e. a bitwise AND gate with 16 inputs , Multiplexors , Demultiplexors and so on.
